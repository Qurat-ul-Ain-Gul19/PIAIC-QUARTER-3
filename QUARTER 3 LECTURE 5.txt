FEATURE EXTRATION:-
FINE- TUNING:-

in deep leanrinig , feature eng plus transfer learing both used

original classification in ann, cnn just extracts the features

pca converts higher dimension into lower dimensions PCA


if some frozen cnn layers r also trainded wd Ann layers this is called fine-tuning

augmentation is only applied to training data
