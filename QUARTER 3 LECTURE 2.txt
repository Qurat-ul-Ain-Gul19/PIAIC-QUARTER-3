models = sequential, functional api,
model.add(layers.convd(32,(3,3),activation='relu')
    here 32= no of filters
    means that from that single pic ,32 further pics will b formed
   CNN itself defines and refines which set of filters to be used to get maximum intitution from the picture

.....filter finds edges in the picture

In Convolutional Neural Networks, Filters detect spatial patterns such as edges in an image by
detecting the changes in intensity values of the image

some,some sharp,some find edges

filters refine ur pics

......here (3,3) is the size of window of convolutional network
kernal seize is mostly 3,3 or 5,5
mostly (3,3)

f4 to fix a cell in excell

if we choose 7,7 we will get 5,5  remaining 2 will be left



padding effect: Addition od zero on all the sides , if u wish to get same size as of input after applying kernal


after covnet applying the img got , is applied maxpooling

maxpooling kernal size= (2,2)

Maxpooling halves the pixl values,
if 4,4 img thenit willl b converted to 2,2


valid= Trues, then padding is on


one by one, moving is called stride




maxpooling alwayys (2,2) asit halves the pixels.


ikn+b = no of learnable- parameters



bais
Bias is like the intercept added in a linear equation. It is an additional parameter in the Neural Network which is used to adjust the output along with the weighted sum of the inputs to the neuron. Thus, Bias is a 
constant which helps the model in a way that it can fit best for the given data.
