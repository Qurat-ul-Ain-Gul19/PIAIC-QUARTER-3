DOCKER :-
Its basically an eco-sytem where u run and conatin the containers


1.DEVELOPMENT TEAM
2.TESTING TEAM
3.OPERATION TEAM (for hosting it to a remote server)


For shipping the software , u need a conatiner that can aptly send ur product to the other machine
and run well on it as it was on ur machine.
That conatiner would be like copying ur whole OS / cdrive and giving it to the next perosn
but thats not practically possible

so Hypervisor comes into the scene


4.GUEST/VIRTUAL OS (but can do things same as original os)
3.HYPERVISOR / for creating an img of os, so that all the software along wd its dependencies and frameworks used can b ackaged and ported to the next machine
 
2.ORIGINAL OS
1.HARDWARE

Now in form of conatiner we give a virtual img of our OS to the other system
when they get that img/ class they make an object/instance of it in thier own machine and begin using it scroupously


with one class/img u can have multiple instances/objects



SHORTCOMING OF HYPERVISOR:-

every new application will require a new guest OS for it but the phyical resourse/hardware like ram, memoery , etc will be same
so it would be cubersome for ur phyical machine to run multiple os on it

so this probelm gave rise to DOCKER and container systems
