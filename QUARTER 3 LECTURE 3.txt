transfer learning:-
already trained model, v use it for own data, made it learn a few more things on it


trans invariant:-
left.right/ mirror has no effect on covnent
its performance remains same if any operation is performmed ver it 


CNN is standard for all computer vision task..
in pics nd videos conv2d is used, in text convd1d is used 


filters nd output both same


different filters...

max pooling always (2,2)

inputsahpe= (28,28,1) =grey-scale

even in cnn last layer u can apply either ann or any other machine learnnng algo, to flatten the output
one layer gets fored

CNN IS "TRASLATION-INVARIANT"




cnn learns local patterns

avgpooling


to avoid, info loss padding is used, o's r added in all the 4 directons







data augmentation , dropout is used to overcome overfitting.


drop ut is applied to training data only
