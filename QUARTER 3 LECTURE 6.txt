raspberry pie:
credit card size computer , linux os, sd card
has microprossessor, 
if v shrink all of our mother board of a computer to one chip it would become a raspberry pie 




ardino:-controls motors, elctronics componsets, sensors, bluetooth , perfect for making robots
has micro controller

Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.
remote controlcar, speker, light control,

its basically a microcontroller, wd some input ports some output ports rest all things in between u can do

RNN:- RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK

using 1D convents for sequence processing


TEXTUAL CLASSIFICATION:-

each word having a unique integer
computer understands no only



techniques for converting word to integer:-

.....break sentences into tokens

1. one-hot encoding
2.word embedding


issue wd one-hot encoding is infinite no of columns
too large space 
inefficiet use of space

makes sparse matrix , with more 0's
opposite of it is dense matrix

WORD EMBEDDINGS:-
finds similarity between words
low dimensions 
works well on large columns nd vocabulary

coding:-

from keras.layers import Embedding
embedding_layer = Embedding(10000,64)

"word embedding is converting words to integer"

10000 = length of dictionary, 100000 words
64 = length of vector, hr word k against 64 lentgh ka vector bny ga


BAGGING:-

bag of words



hashing
